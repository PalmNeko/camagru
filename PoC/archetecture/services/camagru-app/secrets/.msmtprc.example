# Example for a user configuration file ~/.msmtprc

# With modern mail services that publish autoconfiguration information,
# you can simply run 'msmtp --configure yourmail@example.com' to get
# a basic working configuration.

# This example focusses on TLS and authentication. Features not used here
# include logging, timeouts, SOCKS proxies, TLS parameters, Delivery Status
# Notification (DSN) settings, and more.

# Set default values: use the mail submission port 587, and always use TLS.
# On this port, TLS is activated via STARTTLS.
defaults
port 587
tls on
tls_starttls on

# Define a mail account at a freemail service
account freemail
# Host name of the SMTP server
host smtp.gmail.com
# Envelope-from address
from xxxx@gmail.com
# Authentication
auth on
user xxxx@gmail.com
# Password method 1: Add the password to the system keyring, and let msmtp get
# it automatically. To set the keyring password using libsecret:
# $ secret-tool store --label=msmtp \
#   host smtp.freemail.example \
#   service smtp \
#   user joe.smith
# Password method 2: Store the password in an encrypted file, and tell msmtp
# which command to use to decrypt it. This is usually used with GnuPG, as in
# this example. Usually gpg-agent will ask once for the decryption password.
passwordeval "cat /run/secrets/gmail_password"
# You can also store the password directly in this file or have msmtp ask you
# for it each time you send a mail, but one of the above methods is preferred.

# Set a default account
account default : freemail
